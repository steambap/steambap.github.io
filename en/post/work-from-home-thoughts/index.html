					<p>Since I live in China and work from home since the beginning of Febuary, I should write down some random thoughts about work from home.</p>
<h2 id="busy-or-not">Busy or not?</h2>
<p>When you work at an office, if you need something from a person, you can just go to that person&rsquo;s desk and have a direct conversion with him (or her). Now, when you work from home, the only thing you can do is to send someone a slack message. Sometimes, an hour later, he is going to say to you, hey, I just went to toilet, how can I help you?</p>
<p>Sometimes I can be very busy. Wechat is a popular communication tool in China. So, occasionally, I would get a video meeting request on both slack and wechat. I have to stay in the meeting that started first and deny the one comes later. In office, people will not request to be present in a meeting if you are in another meeting.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings are slightly hard when working from home. When you have a meeting in the office, you can have some quick exchange of information with someone. Lot&rsquo;s of questions and misunderstandings can be solved in this way. But when you have a video meeting or voice meeting, things can be much hard. You cannot see the other person, sometimes there is an overlap of voice, or in some worst cases people could suddenly go offline because of bad internet connection.</p>
