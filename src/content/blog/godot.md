## Godot engine

Recently I finished my first android app for a client work.
Although it make sound weird, I used a game engine called [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for my app.

It is open sourced and released under the permissive MIT license. And it compiles to all desktop and mobile platform as you would expect from a game engine.

The development experience with Godot engine can be very "simple". There is no third party library, package management, or make / bundle process. You pretty much only have the engine itself and the doc. Internet connection is not required, which is great for me. I remember when I tried Google's flutter, it tries to secretly connect to Google's server without respect my proxy setting and ends up crash into GFW.

In Godot engine you have to work with their own Python-like language called GDScript. It is not a very modular or scaleable language, but it gets simple jobs done quickly.

I would not use it in any medium to large app, but it serves me well in my first small app. Thank you Godot!
