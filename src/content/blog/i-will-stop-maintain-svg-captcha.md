## Update March 2020

They don't bother to answer issues or manage pull requests, fuck them.

## What?

I'm the former maintainer of Node.js open source captcha generation library `svg-captcha`.

As you can see, I've put a lot of effort in maintain the repo, as well as reply issues and merge pull requests.

Since I no longer works at Lemonce, I've lost the access to the repo.

[Li Chao](https://github.com/lichaozhy) will take over the maintaince of the library. You can email him: lichao@or-change.cn .

## What happened actually?

I worked at Lemonce(Tianjin Or-change Ltd.) from Dec 2014 to Oct 2017. When I left, the ownership of `svg-captcha` has to be decided. 

Personally, I love Node.js, I love what it brings to frontend. For backend, I would definitely go with Golang. I'll probably use Node for a chatroom, but for now I am done with Node for backend. My new job is frontend only. I do not think I am qualified for maintain the repo if I do not use it myself.

However, I cannot decide the future of the project. Li Chao, my former boss, said that I can only fork the repo, not transfer ownership. It is quite clear at this point that he want to take over the project. 

There're too much forks of everything in the Node community, including Node itself. There're iojs, ayojs, fibjs, etc. The world does not need fives npm modules for generate svg format captcha. Although I can fork the repo and continue my work, I will not do that.
